# Refactoring_Assignment

## Author: alligatormonday (Joseph Jepson)

## Description

This is my submission for my first homework assignment for _the University of Arizona - Coding Bootcamp for Full-Stack Web Development_.

In this assignment, my goals were as follows:
* Refactor HTML and CSS code 
* Create accessibility and sustainability through efficient and clean code
* Use semantic HTML elements that follow a logical structure
* Follow the scout rule, _always leave the code you are editing a little cleaner than you found it_

I built the code in a way that used many of the concepts that have been touched upon over the first week of starting this program. I believe that I have demonstrated my understanding of HTML semantics, and the relationship shared between HTML and CSS. 

With this code, I have followed accessability standards and have provided the client with a site better optimized for search engines. 

Throughout this assignment, **I have learned a lot**! I have a much greater understanding of CSS properties as they relate to classes, ids, and elements. I learned about ways to condense classes and redundacies where necessary. I found success in using detailed comments and documentation to notate my progress within the codebase. I also learned a lot about what _not_ to do. In the beginning, I spent more time than I should have, spinning my wheels on one thing (_Flexbox-Layouts_). This assignment taught me how to; prioritize my time wisely, stick to acceptable criteria (go above and beyond after the basics), when to take a break and step back, and when to ask for help. I tapped multiple individuals to have another pair of eyes and provide me insight on where I might be overlooking something. **Collaboration** was _incredibly_ helpful. 

I'm not sure if there's anything in particular that makes my project **stand out** per se. However, I think this assignment will be an interesting _time-capsule_ that illustrates my first steps venturing into a field that I seemingly know little about. I'm excited to submit this assignment, for your consideration. I hope you'll join me and see what's next on my journey throughout these uncharted waters.
